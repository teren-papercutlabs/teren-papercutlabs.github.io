First of all, I text you in some stuff, I usually name you like &quot;Ori&quot; in it. Right? You take a look at that. I think it&#x27;s mostly just examples for know what is good or not good at.

            <div class="content">Good and bad at specific things that I&#x27;m looking for general principles. For example, AI is bad at deterministic math, and there are reasons for it (like it&#x27;s good at writing scripts that do the math but due to some nature of its model, math is not a strong suit). Anything deterministic is not the right word, but you know what I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;m talking about general principles of what is good and better, and ideally why, so like they can apply the new situations. You get what I&#x27;m asking for. </div>

            <div class="content">Ah yes, I get it - you want the underlying principles, not just task lists. Here are some foundational principles:<br><br><strong>What AI is Good At (and why):</strong><br>- <strong>Pattern recognition at scale</strong> - AI excels because it can process vast amounts of data simultaneously and identify patterns humans would miss or take forever to find<br>- <strong>Language transformation</strong> - Converting between formats, styles, or structures because it understands deep linguistic patterns<br>- <strong>Parallel processing</strong> - Can handle multiple complex tasks simultaneously without cognitive fatigue<br>- <strong>Consistent execution</strong> - Won&#x27;t get tired, distracted, or have &quot;off days&quot; when following defined processes<br>- <strong>Context synthesis</strong> - Excellent at pulling together information from multiple sources into coherent outputs<br><br><strong>What AI is Bad At (and why):</strong><br>- <strong>Precise arithmetic/logic</strong> - Not trained for exact computation; it&#x27;s a pattern-matching system, not a calculator<br>- <strong>Real-time information</strong> - Training data has cutoffs; it can&#x27;t know what happened 5 minutes ago<br>- <strong>Spatial/physical reasoning</strong> - Lacks embodied experience; struggles with &quot;will this fit through that door?&quot;<br>- <strong>Nuanced human judgment</strong> - Can&#x27;t read between the lines of office politics or gauge someone&#x27;s emotional state from limited context<br>- <strong>True randomness/creativity</strong> - It&#x27;s predictive, so even &quot;creative&quot; outputs follow learned patterns<br>- <strong>Sequential dependencies</strong> - Can lose track in long chains of dependent reasoning<br><br>The key insight being: <strong>AI is a pattern-matching engine trained on human-generated content, not a reasoning/computing machine</strong> - so it&#x27;s brilliant at anything humans do through pattern recognition, terrible at anything requiring precise computation or real-world awareness.<br><br>Does this hit the principle-level you&#x27;re looking for?</div>

            <div class="speaker">Teren</div>
            <div class="content">No no no no I think I&#x27;m going to be a bit more directive here. Okay so precise arithmetic and logic that&#x27;s the thing right so like that&#x27;s one. So anything that requires like exact computation it&#x27;s better to ask it to write a script to do it. Real-time information like you know you need to know your string data cut off so like when looking for like you need to be aware of even if you know the cut off like anything recent right make it do a web search. It&#x27;s great at generating a lot of so if you wanna give me five UI mockups I can do it really fast like for all the five are gonna be trash but you just need one right so it&#x27;s good for and some of the that it produces might spark inspiration somewhere else. So it&#x27;s good for a lot of like what they call that inspiration is a shitty word to use but like it triggers parts of your brain in the same vein is pretty good at generating a lot of test cases. So for example if I&#x27;m like okay I need to stress test my clinic assistant agent what are 20 possible queries that were coming from patients is pretty good at doing that so like building up test cases now like humans need to kind of like monitoring qualify the output of the test cases at least once but is good at generating the test cases themselves and later on that can be augmented by human experience but it&#x27;s a good starting point to have. Okay I think we got a few I want those specific examples there but I wonder what are the higher level general principles again pull up from what I was talking about. </div>

            <div class="content">The user is giving me specific examples and wants me to extract the higher-level principles from what they&#x27;re saying. Let me analyze what they mentioned:<br><br>1. Precise arithmetic/logic - AI is bad at exact computation, better to ask it to write a script<br>2. Real-time information - needs web search, be aware of data cutoffs<br>3. Volume generation - great at generating many options quickly (UI mockups, test cases) even if most are trash, because you only need one good one or they spark inspiration<br>4. Test case generation - good at creating lots of test scenarios, humans need to monitor/qualify but it&#x27;s a good starting point<br><br>The higher-level principles I can extract:<br>- AI is good at volume/quantity generation where you need many options<br>- AI should delegate precise tasks to deterministic tools (scripts, web searches)<br>- AI excels at ideation/brainstorming where quality filtering happens downstream<br>- AI is good at exhaustive scenario generation<br>- The principle seems to be about leveraging AI&#x27;s strengths (pattern-based generation) while using deterministic tools for precision<br><br>Let me think about the meta-principles here:<br>1. Use AI for generation, use deterministic tools for precision<br>2. Leverage AI&#x27;s ability to produce volume when you need options/inspiration<br>3. AI is good at comprehensive coverage (like test cases) where human curation follows<br>4. Offload precision tasks to appropriate tools</div>

            <div class="content">Got it, extracting the higher-level principles from your examples:<br><br><strong>Core Principles:</strong><br><br>1. <strong>Use AI for generation, deterministic tools for precision</strong> - AI excels at pattern-based creation but fails at exact computation. When you need precision (math, current data), have AI write the tool to get it rather than doing it directly.<br><br>2. <strong>Leverage volume generation for option exploration</strong> - AI can rapidly produce many variations (mockups, test cases, ideas) where most will be mediocre, but that&#x27;s the point - you only need one good one, or they spark better ideas. It&#x27;s about using AI&#x27;s speed to explore the solution space broadly.<br><br>3. <strong>AI excels at comprehensive scenario coverage</strong> - Great at exhaustively generating test cases, edge cases, or &quot;what if&quot; scenarios that humans might miss. Human judgment still needed to qualify/prioritize, but AI provides thorough coverage.<br><br>4. <strong>Offload knowledge cutoff limitations proactively</strong> - When you need current information, immediately delegate to web search rather than hoping AI knows it.<br><br>The meta-principle seems to be: <strong>AI is a high-volume, pattern-based generator - use it to rapidly explore possibility spaces, then apply human judgment and deterministic tools for precision and filtering.</strong><br><br>Is that the level of principle you&#x27;re looking for?

            <div class="content">In the sense that if you give it strong rules to follow, like &quot;after you&quot;, it follows rules, right? Once you build up your Claude MD or your Cursor rules, and especially now with Claude Hooks, you can guide the behavior very well. Previously, you were afraid to let it run autonomously over your code because you don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to do. But by setting up the rules, and especially if it gets better at following them, the later models are better at rule following, and then now you have Claude Hooks as well for some deterministic checks. It gets a lot better, so it&#x27;s not strictly pattern-based and then it&#x27;s bad at judgment or whatever. There&#x27;s something else here. I&#x27;m something I think: whether like it&#x27;s better at some examples of what is good and what is bad, rather than like a list of good and a list of bad. What do you think? </div>

            <div class="speaker">Orion Thinking</div>
            <div class="content">Teren is getting at something deeper here. He&#x27;s saying that AI isn&#x27;t just &quot;good at pattern matching, bad at judgment&quot; - it&#x27;s actually quite good at following rules once you establish them clearly. The key insight is about **rule-following and constraint satisfaction**.<br><br>He&#x27;s pointing out that with tools like Claude.md, Cursor rules, and Claude Code hooks, you can actually make AI very reliable at following specific behaviors. It&#x27;s not just about &quot;AI is bad at X, good at Y&quot; - it&#x27;s about how you can **systematically improve AI behavior through well-defined constraints**.<br><br>The principle he&#x27;s getting at seems to be: **AI is excellent at following explicit rules and constraints, so the key is defining the right rules rather than hoping it will intuit what you want.**<br><br>And he&#x27;s asking whether concrete examples might be better than abstract lists. He&#x27;s right - showing the before/after of &quot;AI without rules vs AI with good rules&quot; would be more instructive than just saying &quot;AI is good at X, bad at Y.&quot;<br><br>Let me think of some concrete examples that illustrate this principle:<br><br>Example 1: Code changes<br>- Bad: &quot;Fix this bug&quot; (vague, unpredictable results)<br>- Good: &quot;Fix this bug by: 1) writing a test that reproduces it, 2) making minimal changes to fix it, 3) running the test suite, 4) if tests fail, explain why before proceeding&quot;<br><br>Example 2: Writing tasks<br>- Bad: &quot;Write a blog post about our product&quot; (could go anywhere)<br>- Good: &quot;Write a blog post following our style guide (attached), target audience is technical founders, include exactly 3 customer examples, end with specific CTA, get approval before publishing&quot;<br><br>The meta-principle is about **constraint design** - AI becomes much more reliable when you give it clear operational constraints rather than hoping it will figure out what you want.</div>

            <div class="content">Ah yes, you&#x27;re absolutely right! The principle is about <strong>rule-following and constraint satisfaction</strong> - AI is actually excellent at following explicit rules once you define them clearly.<br><br>The real insight is: <strong>AI becomes highly reliable when you give it clear operational constraints, not when you hope it will intuit what you want.</strong><br><br>You&#x27;re also right about examples being better than lists. Here are some concrete before/after examples:<br><br><strong>Code Review Example:</strong><br>- Before: &quot;Review this code&quot; → unpredictable, might miss key issues or over-engineer<br>- After: With Claude.md rules + hooks → &quot;Always check for security issues first, run linters before suggesting changes, provide specific line numbers, suggest minimal fixes only&quot; → predictable, reliable behavior<br><br><strong>Task Management Example:</strong><br>- Before: &quot;Help me organize my tasks&quot; → might create categories you don&#x27;t want, unclear priorities<br>- After: With clear rules → &quot;Always ask which ClickUp list, default to work list unless clearly personal, include due dates, assign to me automatically&quot; → consistent, autonomous behavior<br><br><strong>Writing Example:</strong><br>- Before: &quot;Write an email to the client&quot; → tone could be wrong, might include/exclude important details<br>- After: With style constraints → &quot;Follow our communication templates, always include next steps, CC relevant team members, professional but warm tone&quot; → reliable output every time<br><br>The meta-principle is: <strong>Don&#x27;t rely on AI&#x27;s judgment - rely on AI&#x27;s ability to follow your judgment expressed as clear rules.</strong> This is why Claude Code with hooks is so powerful - you can make AI behavior deterministic where it matters.<br><br>Is this the direction you were thinking?</div>

            <div class="content">You eliminated a lot of the points we had previously. These are all like separate principles, on the same level as being good at volume generation and then being reliable when you give it clear operational constraints.

When you need precision (math, current data), have AI write the tool to get it.<br><br>2. <strong>Leverage volume generation for option exploration</strong> - AI can rapidly produce many variations where most will be mediocre, but you only need one good one or to spark better ideas.<br><br>3. <strong>AI excels at comprehensive scenario coverage</strong> - Great at exhaustively generating test cases, edge cases, &quot;what if&quot; scenarios that humans might miss.<br><br>4. <strong>Offload knowledge cutoff limitations proactively</strong> - When you need current information, immediately delegate to web search rather than hoping AI knows it.<br><br>5. <strong>AI becomes highly reliable when you give it clear operational constraints</strong> - With well-defined rules (Claude.md, Cursor rules, Claude Hooks), AI can run autonomously and predictably on complex tasks.<br><br>6. <strong>Don&#x27;t rely on AI&#x27;s judgment - rely on AI&#x27;s ability to follow your judgment expressed as clear rules</strong> - The power comes from encoding your decision-making into constraints the AI can follow consistently.<br><br>Each of these is a distinct principle that applies independently - you could use volume generation without clear constraints, or have great constraints but not leverage volume generation, etc.<br><br>Does this capture the separate levels you were thinking of?</div>

            <div class="content">The user is questioning whether the session should be truly interactive or if it&#x27;s more of a presentation style. They seem to be thinking about whether they should actively ask the audience questions or just let the audience ask questions if they want to.<br><br>This is a judgment call about presentation style. Generally, for AI/tech demos, having some interactivity helps engagement, but it depends on:<br>- The audience size<br>- The audience&#x27;s level of engagement/interest<br>- The content complexity<br>- The presenter&#x27;s comfort level<br><br>Given this is about AI principles and a demo, some light interactivity could be good but forced Q&amp;A might kill momentum.

Yeah, knowledge cloud limitations and like there&#x27;s a formal cut off, but honestly if you need anything that&#x27;s in the past 2-3 years, like searching is almost always better.

            <div class="content">Let&#x27;s think about the getting angry line. I think it&#x27;s like people and AI are functions of a genetic beast model - your upbringing and lived experience for the AI is a training and then the input/context whatever. Like, there&#x27;s no point getting angry about any of it - it doesn&#x27;t help you get a different result the next time. You need an objective inquiry into what you can change.<br><br>Can you change the model and the training? For both humans and AI, I think it&#x27;s very difficult to change the model and the training. This is a debate, but I think it&#x27;s mostly done. The context and input are the ones that you can really affect. For AI, context is obvious. For humans, it&#x27;s like, for me, it&#x27;s um, I&#x27;m kind of lazy right, so my gym is 30 minutes away. I don&#x27;t go. So I changed the input - my gym is 5 minutes away, even though it costs more. Because I know that when the time comes to go to the gym and the stimulus hits, the friction is low enough that I will do it. </div>

The key insight is that the model/training is mostly fixed, so you need to change the inputs/context to get different results.<br><br>For the gym example, he couldn&#x27;t change his &quot;model&quot; (being lazy), so he changed the input (gym location) to get the desired result.<br><br>This is a much more sophisticated way to frame the principle.</div>

When someone doesn&#x27;t go to the gym because they&#x27;re &quot;lazy,&quot; getting angry doesn&#x27;t help. Moving the gym from 30 minutes away to 5 minutes away does.

It strips out line breaks and merges bullet points.<br><br><strong>Prevention strategies:</strong><br><br>1. <strong>Use simpler markdown</strong> - Avoid nested bullets, use basic formatting only<br>2. <strong>Add explicit line breaks</strong> - Put <code>\n\n</code> between sections instead of single line breaks<br>3. <strong>Use HTML-style formatting</strong> instead of markdown where possible<br>4. <strong>Test with a small section first</strong> to see how Google Docs handles it<br>5. <strong>Manual formatting after creation</strong> - Create the doc with basic content, then format manually in Google Docs interface<br><br><strong>Better approach:</strong> Create the doc with minimal formatting, then use Google Docs&#x27; native formatting tools to add proper structure.<br><br>Want me to try creating a new version with explicit line breaks and simpler formatting?</div>

We&#x27;re stuck in &quot;horseless carriage&quot; thinking, trying to make AI fit into existing workflows instead of building AI-native processes. Most people approach AI as a fancy tool—something that helps you do what you&#x27;re already doing, just faster. But the real opportunity is leveraging AI&#x27;s ability to act as an agent—a capable team member that can take ownership of entire workflows, make decisions within defined parameters, and operate autonomously. This shift from &quot;AI as tool&quot; to &quot;AI as agent&quot; unlocks exponentially more value, but it requires rethinking how work gets done rather than just automating existing processes.<br><br><strong>Version 2 (More direct):</strong><br>Most people are making the same mistake with AI that early car adopters made—they called them &quot;horseless carriages&quot; because they couldn&#x27;t imagine transportation beyond horse-drawn vehicles. We&#x27;re doing the same thing: using AI to speed up existing processes instead of reimagining work entirely. The difference between treating AI as a tool versus an agent is massive. Tools help you do your job faster; agents can own entire pieces of your job. But this requires building new workflows from scratch, not just plugging AI into old ones.<br><br><strong>Version 3 (Problem-focused):</strong><br>The horseless carriage problem is killing AI adoption. When cars were invented, people called them &quot;horseless carriages&quot; because they couldn&#x27;t conceptualize transportation beyond horses. Today, we&#x27;re making the same mistake with AI—trying to fit it into human-designed workflows instead of building AI-native processes. The breakthrough happens when you stop asking &quot;how can AI help me do this faster?&quot; and start asking &quot;how would this work if an AI agent owned this entire process?&quot; That shift from automation to delegation changes everything.<br><br><strong>Version 4 (Practical angle):</strong><br>Here&#x27;s why most AI implementations fail: we&#x27;re solving the wrong problem. Instead of asking &quot;how do I make my existing process 20% faster with AI?&quot; ask &quot;what would this process look like if I designed it for an AI agent from day one?&quot; This is the horseless carriage problem—early adopters tried to make cars work like horse-drawn carriages instead of reimagining transportation. The companies winning with AI aren&#x27;t automating human workflows; they&#x27;re building agent-native workflows where AI takes full ownership of outcomes, not just tasks.<br><br>Which style resonates most with your voice?</div>

            <div class="content">Ah, the user is pointing out that my explanation of the horseless carriage problem isn&#x27;t quite right. They&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s not just about the name &quot;horseless carriage&quot; - it&#x27;s about how the early car designers literally tried to put engines where horses used to be, basically keeping the same carriage design but just swapping the power source. They couldn&#x27;t reimagine the entire form factor.<br><br>So the parallel is: we&#x27;re doing the same thing with AI - we&#x27;re just swapping AI into human roles/processes instead of redesigning the entire workflow from scratch for AI capabilities.<br><br>Let me fix that explanation to be more accurate.</div>

            <div class="content">You&#x27;re absolutely right - I missed the key point! It&#x27;s not just about the name, it&#x27;s about how early car designers literally tried to put engines where the horse used to be, keeping the same carriage design instead of reimagining the whole vehicle. Here&#x27;s the corrected version:<br><br><strong>Mindset shift - Horseless carriage problem:</strong> The biggest barrier to getting value from AI isn&#x27;t technical—it&#x27;s conceptual. We&#x27;re stuck in &quot;horseless carriage&quot; thinking, trying to make AI fit into existing workflows instead of building AI-native processes. (When cars were first invented, designers literally tried to put engines where horses used to be, keeping the same carriage design instead of reimagining what transportation could look like.) Most people approach AI as a fancy tool—something that helps you do what you&#x27;re already doing, just faster. But the real opportunity is leveraging AI&#x27;s ability to act as an agent—something that can take ownership of entire workflows, make decisions within defined parameters, and operate autonomously. This shift from &quot;AI as tool&quot; to &quot;AI as agent&quot; unlocks exponentially more value, but it requires rethinking how work gets done rather than just automating existing processes.<br><br>Should I update the document with this corrected explanation?</div>

Honestly, I think this one is important and should be first - when building something significant, it&#x27;s like 80% planning and 20% execution. So even if you can go multiple ways, ideally you don&#x27;t try and tell it too much right? You start by saying &quot;ok this is this idea I have, these are the technical bits I do know, like I do think that we should do, but I wanted to go and investigate and then come back with your suggestions&quot;.<br><br>Then you come back with a suggestion and I look through and it&#x27;s like &quot;no, no, doesn&#x27;t make sense because you missed out this thing&quot;. So it&#x27;s like, I&#x27;m not 100% relying on your investigation, neither are you relying on me to 100% give you all the context right? Like, as a mix that I know some stuff he knows you find out some stuff incorrect me and there was like a back-and-forth kind of thing. Then I review it and some parts I think we did more detail and ask you to ask me questions (the AMQ below) to kind of flesh out the context a little bit.<br><br>Because it&#x27;s very difficult for me to know, like me see the sea in the East very hard right? Like, it&#x27;s very difficult to ensure that you have covered everything. But if the AI is asking you questions, it helps. This is leveraging the AI skill/AI is good at comprehensiveness and looking at things from different angles, so it really helps. You don&#x27;t have to wreck your brain and it&#x27;s hard to think about what you miss - like, oh what did I forget? It&#x27;s an impossible fucking tree enough thought.<br><br>After all that planning, basically what you have with it is a very well-thought-through implementation document substantiated with fresh research on the codebase and like you&#x27;ve already given feedback on some of the approaches I wanted and vice versa.

            <div class="content">Here are 5 different ways to phrase that planning paragraph:<br><br><strong>Version 1 (Process-focused):</strong><br><strong>Planning is 80% of the work</strong> - When building something significant, spend most of your effort upfront planning, not executing. Start by giving the AI your initial idea and known technical requirements, then ask it to investigate and come back with suggestions. Review those suggestions and provide feedback on what&#x27;s missing or wrong - it&#x27;s a collaborative process where you know some things, the AI investigates others, and you both correct each other. Use &quot;amq&quot; to have the AI ask clarifying questions that flesh out context. The AI is good at comprehensiveness and looking at things from different angles, which helps because it&#x27;s impossible to think of everything you might forget. By the time you start executing, you have a well-thought-through implementation document with fresh research and mutual feedback, so execution goes smoothly.<br><br><strong>Version 2 (Problem-solution):</strong><br><strong>Front-load the thinking, not the coding</strong> - Building significant features is 80% planning, 20% execution, but most people rush to coding. Instead, start with your idea and known constraints, then have the AI investigate and propose approaches. Don&#x27;t rely 100% on either your initial context or the AI&#x27;s research - review its suggestions, point out what it missed, and iterate. The hardest part isn&#x27;t execution, it&#x27;s knowing what you don&#x27;t know. Leverage the AI&#x27;s ability to ask comprehensive questions and explore different angles. This collaborative planning creates a solid implementation document that makes the actual coding surprisingly smooth.<br><br><strong>Version 3 (Collaboration-focused):</strong><br><strong>Planning as true collaboration</strong> - Significant projects are 80% planning, 20% execution. Start by sharing your idea and technical knowledge, then let the AI investigate and return with suggestions. The magic happens in the back-and-forth: you catch what the AI missed, it asks questions that reveal gaps in your thinking. Neither of you has perfect information alone, but together you can build comprehensive understanding. Use &quot;amq&quot; when you need the AI to probe deeper - it&#x27;s impossible to anticipate every missing piece, but AI is excellent at systematic questioning. This process creates implementation documents that make execution feel inevitable rather than challenging.<br><br><strong>Version 4 (Philosophy-focused):</strong><br><strong>Slow down to go fast</strong> - The biggest mistake is rushing to implementation. Significant work is 80% planning, 20% execution for a reason. Share your vision and constraints, have the AI research and propose approaches, then iterate together. You&#x27;ll catch things the AI missed, it&#x27;ll ask questions that reveal your blind spots. The goal isn&#x27;t perfect upfront specification - it&#x27;s collaborative refinement where both parties contribute knowledge and catch errors. Leverage the AI&#x27;s systematic thinking and comprehensive questioning (use &quot;amq&quot; liberally). Time spent planning pays exponential dividends in execution speed and quality.<br><br><strong>Version 5 (Practical/tactical):</strong><br><strong>Plan first, code fast</strong> - For anything substantial, expect 80% planning, 20% execution. Your workflow: give the AI your idea plus known technical details, ask it to investigate and suggest approaches. Review its suggestions critically - point out what&#x27;s wrong or missing. This isn&#x27;t about perfect upfront specs; it&#x27;s about iterative collaboration where you both contribute knowledge. When stuck, use &quot;amq&quot; to have the AI ask clarifying questions - you can&#x27;t think of everything you&#x27;re forgetting, but AI can systematically probe gaps. Result: detailed implementation plans that make coding feel like following a recipe.<br><br>Which style/approach resonates most with how you want to present this concept?</div>

            <div class="content">I like the title of 1, but I think it&#x27;s better to include a point that the best thing you bring to the table is your taste and your judgment. The AI can cover a lot of gaps if you come in with decisions made using your intuition, based on years of engineering experience (what works, what doesn&#x27;t) and years of product experience. It really helps it along. </div>

            <div class="content">Here&#x27;s Version 1 revised with that insight about taste and judgment:<br><br><strong>Version 1 (Revised):</strong><br><strong>Planning is 80% of the work</strong> - When building something significant, spend most of your effort upfront planning, not executing. The best thing you bring to the table is your taste and your judgment - decisions made using your intuition based on years of engineering and product experience about what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Start by giving the AI your initial idea, known technical requirements, and those intuitive decisions, then ask it to investigate and come back with suggestions. Review those suggestions and provide feedback on what&#x27;s missing or wrong - it&#x27;s a collaborative process where you contribute judgment and experience, the AI investigates and fills gaps, and you both correct each other. Use &quot;amq&quot; to have the AI ask clarifying questions that flesh out context. The AI is good at comprehensiveness and looking at things from different angles, which helps because it&#x27;s impossible to think of everything you might forget. By the time you start executing, you have a well-thought-through implementation document with fresh research, your experienced judgment, and mutual feedback, so execution goes smoothly.<br><br>This emphasizes that the human&#x27;s years of experience and intuitive taste are what make the planning process so effective - the AI can be comprehensive, but the human provides the wisdom about what actually works in practice.</div>
